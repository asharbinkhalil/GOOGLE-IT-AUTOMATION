Redirections, Pipes and Signals
Managing streams
These are the redirectors that we can use to take control of the streams of our programs

command > file: redirects standard output, overwrites file

command >> file: redirects standard output, appends to file

command < file: redirects standard input from file

command 2> file: redirects standard error to file

command1 | command2: connects the output of command1 to the input of command2

Operating with processes
These are some commands that are useful to know in Linux when interacting with processes. Not all of them are explained in videos, so feel free to investigate them on your own.

ps: lists the processes executing in the current terminal for the current user

ps ax: lists all processes currently executing for all users  

ps e: shows the environment for the processes listed  

kill PID: sends the SIGTERM signal to the process identified by PID

fg: causes a job that was stopped or in the background to return to the foreground

bg: causes a job that was stopped to go to the background

jobs: lists the jobs currently running or stopped

top: shows the processes currently using the most CPU time (press "q" to quit)
